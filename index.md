# About Me

I am a PhD Candidate in the [Dept. of Informatics, Systems and Communication](https://phd-computer-science.disco.unimib.it/) of the University of Milano-Bicocca, working on Deep Learning and anomaly detection. I will submit my thesis by February 2023, and defend it in mid 2023.

During my PhD, I worked on fundamental Deep Learning challenges, including estimating input example difficulty in deep models, interpreting piecewise linear Deep Neural Networks and adversarial examples detection. Furthermore, I also contributed to many interdisciplinary projects, such as imputation and denoising in single-cell data and flux prediction in metabolic networks.
